# CDF_Analysis
Cumulative distribution functions: An alternative approach to examine the triggering of prepared motor actions in the StartReact effect

This repo contains a replicable CDF analysis and simulated data. It is hoped this will aid in use of the CDF categorisation method in future research.
The R script replicates the entire analysis including data structuring and plotting.
Data was simulated by generating random numbers from a gaussian distribution. This was repeated four times, once for each example movement type.

Data from the studies analysed in the above article may be retrieved at the request of the original authors.
